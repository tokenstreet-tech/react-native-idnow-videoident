Many thanks to [Nuri](https://nuri.com/) for their work on the package [react-native-idnow](https://github.com/bitwala/react-native-idnow). The first draft was heavily inspired by it.
However, almost the entire code has been rewritten since then, so there are now many differences:

## Features

-   All configuration options of the SDKs are possible from the JavaScript side (except `externalLogger`, `customBackButtonItem`, `customCancelButton` & `customAgentView` for iOS, and the [colors for Android](https://github.com/tokenstreet-tech/react-native-idnow-videoident/issues/139))
-   Latest dependencies of the IDnow [iOS](https://github.com/idnow/de.idnow.ios) and [Android](https://github.com/idnow/de.idnow.android) SDKs - Secured by Dependabot
-   No need to manually include native files
-   Published as CommonJS & ESmodules
-   Strong type declarations are included in this package - There isn't a single `any`
